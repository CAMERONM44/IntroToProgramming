    The [Serializable] attribute in C# is used to indicate that a class or struct can be "serialized." 
    Serialization is the process of converting an object’s state (its data) into a format that can be stored (such as in memory or on disk) or sent across a network. 
    Unity Inspector Display:

    When a struct or class is marked [Serializable] in Unity, Unity can display it in the Inspector window. 
    This allows developers to edit and view the fields of the struct directly in the Unity Editor, making it easier to set initial values and tweak data without writing additional code.
    For example, in this case, ActionMapData is marked as [Serializable], so all fields (like actionName, keycodeDisplay, and defaultKey) will be visible in the Inspector for easy editing.

    Data Conversion (Serialization):

    Beyond Unity, [Serializable] allows the struct to be broken down into a series of bytes, known as a byte[] array (or binary data).  
    This is useful when you need to save the struct’s data to a file, send it over a network, or store it for later use.
    Converting to a byte[] array can make data storage and transfer more efficient, as it’s in a compact binary format.

    In summary, [Serializable] makes it easy to work with data in the Unity Editor by making fields visible in the Inspector and enables data storage, sharing, and transfer by allowing the struct to be converted into binary format.
